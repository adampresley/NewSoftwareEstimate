# Software Estimate Template Sublime Text Plugin

This is a small plugin which adds a new command to create a software estimate document in Markdown syntax. The command, when activated via the *Command Palette* will prompt you for a project name. Once entered a new tab is created with that information filled into the title and the start of a template is made. This template is really only useful for me, and has a section for descriptions and observations, and a table for tasks.

### Activating

In Windows or Linux press **CTRL + SHIFT + P**, and OSX press **CMD + SHIFT + P**, to activate the *Command Palette*, then start typing *software estimate*. As you type the commands available will start to filter and you should see the command **New Software Estimate**. Press **ENTER** on this command.

Next you will be prompted to enter a project name. After entering this press **ENTER**. This should be a short, descriptive title. After pressing **ENTER** you will have a new estimate template.
